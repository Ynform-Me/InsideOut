# New InsideOut project

Places sources under `src` and resources under `resources`.  If you use separate tests, they go under `test`.

Or you can use any of the usual directory conventions (`/src/main/clojure`, etc.).  InsideOut will find your sources, tests, and resources and let you develop, well, from the InsideOut perspective.
